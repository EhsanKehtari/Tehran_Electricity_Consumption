# Tehran_Electricity_Consumption
## Abstract
This project was meant to conduct a modular statistical and data-analytical study of Tehran's electricity consumption using Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries in Python.

Provided with three csv data files, concerning Tehran's electricity consumption and temperature from 1390 through 1396 (2011 through 2018), Following questions were answered:
1. Difference in electricity consumption among different days throughout a week (Q1)
2. Difference in electricity consumption among different hours throughout a day (Q2)
3. Difference in electricity consumption among different seasons throughout a year (Q3)
4. Correlation between electricity consumption and temperature (Q4)
5. Most influential factor (hour, weekday, season, temperature) in electricity consumption (Q5)
6. Average year-to-year electricity consumption increase (Q6)
7. Loadshed Occurence among different hours throughout a day, in case of excessive consumption (Q7)

In addition to aforementioned files, 2 more helper functions were used (commited with $helper_function message) that deal with date conversions and further necessary calculations.
One final file was also created to produce a collective final report on the whole project using files above.
